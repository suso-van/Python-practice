# Python Programming Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my **Python practice code**, focused on **problem-solving, clean code, and real-world programming patterns**.  
The goal is to develop clarity in logic while writing readable and maintainable Python.

This repository reflects a disciplined approach to learning fundamentals before moving to advanced application development.

## Topics Covered
- Python basics and control flow  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- String manipulation  
- File handling  
- Exception handling  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Basic algorithms and logical problems  

## Learning Objectives
- Improve logical thinking using Python  
- Write clean, idiomatic, and maintainable code  
- Build a foundation for backend, data, and automation projects  

## How to Run
```
python program.py
python3 program.py
```
